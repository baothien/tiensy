\section{Cambridge dataset}
The dataset used in our implementation is from Cambridge University. The Cambridge DT-MRI dataset consists of a 3D array of voxels, for each of which a 2.5x2.5 diffusion tensor is calculated. Here are some features of this dataset
\begin{itemize}
	\item $12$ subjects (taken on 12 healthy persons)
	\item $101$ ($+1$, i.e. $b=0$) gradients
	\item bvalues arrange from 0 to 4000
	\item Voxel size: $2.5 \times 2.5 \times 2.5 mm^3$.
\end{itemize}
