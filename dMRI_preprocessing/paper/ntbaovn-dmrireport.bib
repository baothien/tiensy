    abstract = {{In this article, we focus on the parameterization of non-rigid geometrical deformations with a small number of flexible degrees of freedom. In previous work, we proposed a general framework called polyaffine to parameterize deformations with a finite number of rigid or affine components, while guaranteeing the invertibility of global deformations. However, this framework lacks some important properties: the inverse of a polyaffine transformation is not polyaffine in general, and the polyaffine fusion of affine components is not invariant with respect to a change of coordinate system. We present here a novel general framework, called Log-Euclidean polyaffine, which overcomes these defects.We also detail a simple algorithm, the Fast Polyaffine Transform, which allows to compute very efficiently Log-Euclidean polyaffine transformations and their inverses on regular grids. The results presented here on real 3D locally affine registration suggest that our novel framework provides a general and efficient way of fusing local rigid or affine deformations into a global invertible transformation without introducing artifacts, independently of the way local deformations are first estimated.}},

@article{durrleman2010registration,
    abstract = {{This paper proposes a generic framework for the registration, the template estimation and the variability analysis of white matter fiber bundles extracted from diffusion images. This framework is based on the metric on currents for the comparison of fiber bundles. This metric measures anatomical differences between fiber bundles, seen as global homologous structures across subjects. It avoids the need to establish correspondences between points or between individual fibers of different bundles. It can measure differences both in terms of the geometry of the bundles (like its boundaries) and in terms of the density of fibers within the bundle. It is robust to fiber interruptions and reconnections. In addition, a recently introduced sparse approximation algorithm allows us to give an interpretable representation of the fiber bundles and their variations in the framework of currents. First, we used this metric to drive the registration between two sets of homologous fiber bundles of two different subjects. A dense deformation of the underlying white matter is estimated, which is constrained by the bundles seen as global anatomical landmarks. By contrast, the alignment obtained from image registration is driven only by the local gradient of the image. Second, we propose a generative statistical model for the analysis of a collection of homologous bundles. This model consistently estimates prototype fiber bundles (called template), which capture the anatomical invariants in the population, a set of deformations, which align the geometry of the template to that of each subject and a set of residual perturbations. The statistical analysis of both the deformations and the residuals describe the anatomical variability in terms of geometry (stretching, torque, etc.) and  ” texture” (fiber density, etc.). Third, this statistical modeling allows us to simulate new synthetic bundles according to the estimated variability. This gives a way to interpret the anatomical features that the model detects consistently across the subjects. This may be used to better understand the bias introduced by the fiber extraction methods and eventually to give anatomical characterization of the normal or pathological variability of fiber bundles.}},

The framework relies on the direct registration between the fibers, without requiring any intensity-based registration as preprocessing. An affine transform is recovered together with a set of segmented fibers. A recently introduced probabilistic boosting tree classifier is used in a segmentation refinement step to improve the precision of the target tract segmentation. The proposed method compares favorably with a state-of-the-art intensity-based algorithm for affine registration of DTI tractographies. Segmentation results for 12 major WM tracts are demonstrated. Quantitative results are also provided for the segmentation of a particularly difficult case, the optic radiation tract. An average precision of 80\% and recall of 55\% were obtained for the optimal configuration of the presented method.}},

As a similarity measure, the mean squared difference (MSD) of corresponding fiber pathways in (kappa, tau)-space is chosen. After the MSD is minimized along the arc length of the curve, principal component analysis is applied to calculate the transformation parameters. In addition, a scale-space representation of the space curves is incorporated, resulting in a multiscale robust coregistration technique. This fully automatic technique inherently allows one to apply region of interest (ROI) coregistration, and is adequate for performing both global and local transformations. Simulations were performed on synthetic DT data to evaluate the coregistration accuracy and precision. An in vivo coregistration example is presented and compared with a voxel-based coregistration approach, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of the proposed technique to align DT data of the human brain.

@article{zhu2002influence,
    abstract = {{Mutual-information maximization is one of the most popular algorithms for automatic image registration. However, many implementation issues have not been evaluated in a single, coherent context. Methods: Twenty-one registrations between MR and SPECT brain images (8 patients) were achieved by mutual-information maximization with different implementation strategies. The results of a popular strategy were chosen as the standard. All other results were compared with the standard, and the statistics of misregistrations were computed. The registration speed, accuracy, precision, and success rate were assessed. Results: Compared with trilinear interpolation, nearest-neighbor interpolation slightly sped the registration process, but with a lower success rate. The number of bins used to estimate the probability density function (pdf) affects the speed and robustness. Using fewer bins yielded a less robust registration. Adaptively changing the number of bins increased the registration speed and robustness. Simplex optimization increased the registration speed considerably, with a slightly degraded success rate. Simplex optimization with adaptive bin strategy improved the success rate and further decreased the registration time. Multiresolution optimization yielded a better success rate, with little effect on the accuracy and precision of registration. An increase in the number of resolution levels increased the success rate. Multisampling optimization also improved the success rate, but the results were less accurate and precise than those obtained with multiresolution optimization, with an increase in the number of levels decreasing the performance. Segmentation affected the registration speed and success rate. Because segmentation is problem specific, the effects were not conclusive. Conclusion: Different implementation strategies considerably affect the performance of automatic image registration by mutual-information maximization. On the basis of the experimental findings, we suggest that the best implementation strategy would include trilinear interpolation, adaptive change of the number of bins when estimating pdf, and exploitation of a simplex optimization algorithm with a multiresolution scheme.}},

@article{smith2006tract,
    abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.}},

We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine, and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances, navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally, previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways. This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study of fiber connections among anatomically and functionally defined brain regions in individual human subjects.}},

First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.}},

This technique is based on successive anisotropic diffusion simulations over the human brain, which are utilized to construct three dimensional diffusion fronts. The fiber pathways are determined by evaluating the distance and orientation from the fronts to their corresponding diffusion seeds. Synthetic and real DT-MRI data are employed to demonstrate the tracking scheme. It is shown that the synthetic tracts are accurately replicated, and several major white matter fiber pathways can be reproduced noninvasively, with the tract branching being allowed. Since simulating the diffusion process, which is truly a physical phenomenon reflecting the underlying architecture of cerebral tissues, makes full use of the diffusion tensor data, including both the magnitude and orientation information, the proposed approach is expected to enhance robustness and reliability in white matter fiber reconstruction.}},

    abstract = {{We introduce a method for estimating regional connectivity in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) based on a fluid mechanics model. We customize the Navier-Stokes equations to include information from the diffusion tensor and simulate an artificial fluid flow. The velocity vector field of this fluid construct is then used as a connectivity metric. We generate probable connection paths by maximizing the fluid velocity along a path between two regions of interest while constraining its bending energy. Our method is based on a second-order nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) and incorporates local anisotropy and similarity measurements into a viscosity term, which extends previous linear first-order methods. We tested our algorithm on a digital DTI phantom. Our method was able to correctly segment the structure of the phantom with various levels of noise, despite local distortion of the image pattern. We applied our method to DTI volumes from a normal human subject. Seed points were chosen along the corticospinal tracts, white matter regions with well-known connectivity. Our method produced paths that were consistent with both known anatomy and directionally encoded color (DEC) images of the DTI volumes. Applying our method to a digital phantom that simulates discrete white matter lesions, we also demonstrate that the fluid velocity field around areas of simulated localized white matter disruption becomes dampened and turbulent compared to the heat flow field from a first order PDE method. This provides a means for identifying lesion position from the fluid velocity field}},

Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity.}},

During the last 25 years, diffusion MRI has been extraordinarily successful (with more than 300,000 entries on Google Scholar for diffusion MRI). Its main clinical domain of application has been neurological disorders, especially for the management of patients with acute stroke. It is also rapidly becoming a standard for white matter disorders, as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can reveal abnormalities in white matter fiber structure and provide outstanding maps of brain connectivity. The ability to visualize anatomical connections between different parts of the brain, non-invasively and on an individual basis, has emerged as a major breakthrough for neurosciences. The driving force of dMRI is to monitor microscopic, natural displacements of water molecules that occur in brain tissues as part of the physical diffusion process. Water molecules are thus used as a probe that can reveal microscopic details about tissue architecture, either normal or in a diseased state.}},

Running the streamline process repeatedly using Monte Carlo methods to exploit this inherent uncertainty generates maps of connection probability. Uncertainty is defined by interpreting the shape of the diffusion orientation profile provided by the diffusion tensor in terms of the underlying microstructure. Results: Two candidates for describing the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor are proposed and maps of probability of connection to chosen start points or regions are generated in a number of major tracts.

We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">q</emphasis>-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions. </para>}},

    abstract = {{Previous research in non-human primates has shown that the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), a major intrahemispheric fiber tract, is actually composed of four separate components. In humans, only post-mortem investigations have been available to examine the trajectory of this tract. This study evaluates the hypothesis that the four subcomponents observed in non-human primates can also be found in the human brain using in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). The results of our study demonstrated that the four subdivisions could indeed be identified and segmented in humans. SLF I is located in the white matter of the superior parietal and superior frontal lobes and extends to the dorsal premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. SLF II occupies the central core of the white matter above the insula. It extends from the angular gyrus to the caudal--lateral prefrontal regions. SLF III is situated in the white matter of the parietal and frontal opercula and extends from the supramarginal gyrus to the ventral premotor and prefrontal regions. The fourth subdivision of the SLF, the arcuate fascicle, stems from the caudal part of the superior temporal gyrus arches around the caudal end of the Sylvian fissure and extends to the lateral prefrontal cortex along with the SLF II fibers. Since DT-MRI allows the precise definition of only the stem portion of each fiber pathway, the origin and termination of the subdivisions of SLF are extrapolated from the available data in experimental material from non-human primates.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to the Stejskal–Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration, eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion, which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization. We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased brain tissue.}},

@article{bihan2001tensor,
    abstract = {{The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:534–546. {\copyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

                This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.

    abstract = {{This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3 T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds.}},
