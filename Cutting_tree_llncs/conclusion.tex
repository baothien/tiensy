\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

the contribution of the paper

what is the limitation of our proposed methods

- the need of visualization the large dataset $\mathcal{X}$ at different scales, not display all the dataset \textbf{need to investigate}

Contents of the paper
In this work we describe the algorithmic solutions we adopted in order
to build the interactive visualization large data
