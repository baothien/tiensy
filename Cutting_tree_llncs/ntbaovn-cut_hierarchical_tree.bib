    abstract = {{We developed a novel interactive system for human brain tractography segmentation to assist neuroanatomists in identifying white matter anatomical structures of interest from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data. The difficulty in segmenting and navigating tractographies lies in the very large number of reconstructed neuronal pathways, i.e. the streamlines, which are in the order of hundreds of thousands with modern dMRI techniques. The novelty of our system resides in presenting the user a clustered version of the tractography in which she selects some of the clusters to identify a superset of the streamlines of interest. This superset is then re-clustered at a finer scale and again the user is requested to select the relevant clusters. The process of re-clustering and manual selection is iterated until the remaining streamlines faithfully represent the desired anatomical structure of interest. In this work we present a solution to solve the computational issue of clustering a large number of streamlines under the strict time constraints requested by the interactive use. The solution consists in embedding the streamlines into a Euclidean space and then in adopting a state- of-the art scalable implementation of the k-means algorithm. We tested the proposed system on tractographies from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and healthy subjects that we collected for a forthcoming study about the systematic differences between their corticospinal tracts.}},

This paper tries to increase our understanding of approaches to the problem, building on the Generalized Fisheye View framework. Three issues are discussed. First a number of existing techniques are unified by the commonality of what they show, certain fisheye-related subsets, with the techniques differing only in how they show those subsets. Then the elevated importance of these subsets, and their generality, is used to discuss the possibility of non-visual fisheye-views, to attack problems not so amenable to visualization. Finally, several models are given for why these subsets might be important in user interactions, with the goal of better informing design rationales.}},

We propose new kernels with a parameter to control the complexity of the subtrees used as features to represent the graphs. This parameter allows to smoothly interpolate between classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks, on the one hand, and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees, on the other hand. We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation. The first extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space, and the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations. We validate experimentally these new kernels on problems of toxicity and anti-cancer activity prediction for small molecules with support vector machines.}},

    abstract = {{The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time-varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph-structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review first considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.}},

However, most existing visual exploration tools do not scale well for large data sets, i.e., the level of cluttering on the screen is typically unacceptable and the performance is poor. To solve the cluttered interface problem, visualization tools have recently been extended to support hierarchical views of the data, with support for focusing and drilling-down using interactive brushes. To solve the scalability problem, we now investigate how best to couple such a near real-time responsive visualization tool with a database management system. This integration must be done carefully, since the direct implementation of the visual user interactions on hierarchical datasets corresponds to recursive query processing and thus is highly inefficient. For this problem, we have developed a tree labeling method, called MinMax tree, that allows the movement of the on-line recursive processing into an off-line precomputation step. Thus at run time, the recursive processing operations translate into linear cost range queries. Secondly, we employ a main memory access strategy to support incremental loading of data into the main memory. The techniques have been incorporated into XmdvTool, a visual exploration tool, to achieve scalability. Lastly, we report experimental results that illustrate the impact of the proposed techniques on the system's overall performance.}},

Verifying that potential clusterings are real in some objective sense is receiving more attention as the number of new clustering algorithms and their applications grow. We consider one aspect of this question and study the stability of a hierarchical structure with a variation on a measure of stability proposed in the literature.(1,2) Our measure of stability is appropriate for proximity matrices whose entries are on an ordinal scale. We randomly split the data set, cluster the two halves, and compare the two hierarchical clusterings with the clustering achieved on the entire data set. Two stability statistics, based on the Goodman-Kruskal rank correlation coefficient, are defined. The distributions of these statistics are estimated with Monte Carlo techniques for two clustering methods (single-link and complete-link) and under two conditions (randomly selected proximity matrices and proximity matrices with good hierarchical structure). The stability measures are applied to some real data sets.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Many bioinformatics analyses, ranging from gene clustering to phylogenetics, produce hierarchical trees as their main result. These are used to represent the relationships among different biological entities, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretation. A number of standalone programs are available that focus on tree visualization or that perform specific analyses on them. However, such applications are rarely suitable for large-scale surveys, in which a higher level of automation is required. Currently, many genome-wide analyses rely on tree-like data representation and hence there is a growing need for scalable tools to handle tree structures at large scale.RESULTS:Here we present the Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE), a python programming toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees. ETE libraries provide a broad set of tree handling options as well as specific methods to analyze phylogenetic and clustering trees. Among other features, ETE allows for the independent analysis of tree partitions, has support for the extended newick format, provides an integrated node annotation system and permits to link trees to external data such as multiple sequence alignments or numerical arrays. In addition, ETE implements a number of built-in analytical tools, including phylogeny-based orthology prediction and cluster validation techniques. Finally, ETE's programmable tree drawing engine can be used to automate the graphical rendering of trees with customized node-specific visualizations.CONCLUSIONS:ETE provides a complete set of methods to manipulate tree data structures that extends current functionality in other bioinformatic toolkits of a more general purpose. ETE is free software and can be downloaded from http://ete.cgenomics.org webcite.}},

Due to the size of the screen and number of pixels available, visualizing more than a few thousand data points generally leads to clutter and occlusion. This in turn restricts our ability to detect, classify, and measure phenomena of interest, such as clusters, anomalies, trends, and patterns. In this paper we describe our experiences in the development of multi-resolution visualization techniques for large multivariate data sets. By hierarchically clustering the data and displaying aggregation information for each cluster, we can examine the data set at multiple levels of abstraction. In addition, by providing powerful navigation and filtering operations, we can create an environment suitable for interactive exploration without overloading the user with dense information displays. In this paper, we illustrate that our hierarchical displays are general by successfully applying them to four popular yet non-scalable visualizations, namely parallel coordinates, glyphs, scatterplot matrices and dimensional stacking.}},

@article{yang2003interactive,
    abstract = {{Numerous multivariate visualization techniques and systems have been developed in the past three decades to visually analyze and explore multivariate data being produced daily in application areas ranging from stock markets to the earth and space sciences. However, traditional multivariate visualization techniques typically do not scale well to large multivariate data sets, with the latter becoming more and more common nowadays. This paper proposes a general framework for interactive hierarchical displays (IHDs) to tackle the clutter problem faced by traditional multivariate visualization techniques when analyzing large data sets. The underlying principle of this framework is to develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and to use hierarchical variations of traditional multivariate visualization techniques to convey aggregation information about the resulting clusters. Users can then explore their desired focus region at different levels of detail, using our suite of navigation and filtering tools. We describe this IHD framework and its full implementation on four traditional multivariate visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinates (Inselberg and Dimsdale, Proceedings of Visualization (1990) 361; Wegman, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 411(85) (1990) 664), star glyphs (Siegel et al., Surgery 72 (1972) 126), scatterplot matrices (Cleveland and McGill, Dynamics Graphics for Statistics (1988)), and dimensional stacking (LeBlanc et al., Proceedings of Visualization 90 (1995) 271), as implemented in the XmdvTool system (Ward, Proceedings of Visualization 94 (1994) 326; Martin and Ward, Proceedings of Visualization 95 (1995) 271; Fua et al., Proceedings of Visualization 99 (1999) 43; Proceedings of Information Visualization 99 (1999) 58).

    abstract = {{Rapid growth of the amount of genome sequence data requires enhancing exploratory analysis tools, with analysis being performed in a fast and robust manner. Users need data representations serving different purposes: from seeing overall structure and data coverage to evolutionary processes during a particular season. Our approach to the problem is in constructing hierarchies of data representations, and providing users with representations adaptable to specific goals. It can be done efficiently because the structure of a typical influenza dataset is characterized by low estimated values of the Kolmogorov (box) dimension. Multi-scale methodologies allow interactive visual representation of the dataset and accelerate computations by importance sampling. Our tree visualization approach is based on a subtree aggregation with subscale resolution. It allows interactive refinements and coarsening of subtree views. For importance sampling large influenza datasets, we construct sets of well-scattered points (e-nets). While a tree build for a global sample provides a coarse-level representation of the whole dataset, it can be complemented by trees showing more details in chosen areas. To reflect both global dataset structure and local details correctly, we perform local refinement gradually, using a multiscale hierarchy of e-nets. Our hierarchical representations allow fast metadata searching.}},

Most existing community detection algorithms produce a hierarchical structure of communities and seek a partition into communities that optimizes a given quality function.

First we show how to optimize a general class of additive quality functions (containing the modularity, the performance, and a new similarity based quality function which we propose) over a larger set of partitions than the classical methods. Moreover, we define new multi-scale quality functions which make it possible to detect different scales at which meaningful community structures appear, while classical approaches find only one partition.}},

    abstract = {{We propose a hybrid clustering method, hierarchical ordered partitioning and collapsing hybrid (HOPACH), which is a hierarchical tree of clusters. The methodology combines the strengths of both partitioning and agglomerative clustering methods. At each node, a cluster is partitioned into two or more smaller clusters with an enforced ordering of the clusters. Collapsing steps uniting the two closest clusters into one cluster can be used to correct for errors made in the partitioning steps. We implement a version of HOPACH which optimizes a measure of clustering strength, such as average silhouette, at each partitioning and collapsing step. An important benefit of a hierarchical tree is that one can look at clusters at increasing levels of detail. We propose to visualize the clusters at any level of the tree by plotting the distance matrix corresponding with an ordering of the clusters and an ordering of elements within the clusters. A final ordered list of elements is obtained by running down the tree completely. The bootstrap can be used to establish the reproducibility of the clusters and the overall variability of the followed procedure. The power of the methodology compared to current algorithms is illustrated with simulated and publicly available cancer gene expression data sets.}},

                This work describes a reproducibility analysis of scalar water diffusion parameters, measured within white matter tracts segmented using a probabilistic shape modelling method. In common with previously reported neighbourhood tractography (NT) work, the technique optimises seed point placement for fibre tracking by matching the tracts generated using a number of candidate points against a reference tract, which is derived from a white matter atlas in the present study. No direct constraints are applied to the fibre tracking results. An Expectation-Maximisation algorithm is used to fully automate the procedure, and make dramatically more efficient use of data than earlier NT methods. Within-subject and between-subject variances for fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity within the tracts are then separated using a random effects model. We find test-retest coefficients of variation (CVs) similar to those reported in another study using landmark-guided single seed points; and subject to subject CVs similar to a constraint-based multiple ROI method. We conclude that our approach is at least as effective as other methods for tract segmentation using tractography, whilst also having some additional benefits, such as its provision of a goodness-of-match measure for each segmentation.

                Voxel-based analyses (VBA) are increasingly being used to detect white matter abnormalities with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in different types of pathologies. However, the validity, specificity, and sensitivity of statistical inferences of group differences to a large extent depend on the quality of the spatial normalization of the DTI images. Using high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration techniques that are able to align both the spatial and orientational diffusion information and incorporate appropriate templates that contain this complete DT information may improve this quality. Alternatively, a hybrid technique such as tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) may improve the reliability of the statistical results by generating voxel-wise statistics without the need for perfect image alignment and spatial smoothing. In this study, we have used (1) a coregistration algorithm that was optimized for coregistration of DTI data and (2) a population-based DTI atlas to reanalyze our previously published VBA, which compared the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with those of healthy controls. Additionally, we performed a complementary TBSS analysis to improve our understanding and interpretation of the VBA results. We demonstrate that, as the overall variance of the diffusion properties is lowered after normalizing the DTI data with such recently developed techniques (VBA using our own optimized high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration and TBSS), more reliable voxel-wise statistical results can be obtained than had previously been possible, with our VBA and TBSS yielding very similar results. This study provides support for the view of ALS as a multisystem disease, in which the entire frontotemporal lobe is implicated.

This paper presents a new framework for the visualisation of hierarchies called the hierarchical visualisation system (HVS). HVS is a general framework implemented in Java. It provides a synchronised, multiple view environment for visualising, exploring and managing large hierarchies. HVS reads hierarchies either from the file system or from TreeML files. Eleven hierarchy browsers have so far been implemented within HVS, including: traditional tree views, the classic Walker tree layout, information pyramids, treemaps, a hyperbolic browser, sunburst, and cone trees. In addition to being a tool to explore and manage hierarchies, HVS was also designed to provide a platform for the empirical evaluation and comparison of different hierarchy browsers. The hierarchical visualisation testing environment (HVTE) is a semi-automated testing environment built on top of HVS. HVTE is being used for a series of comparative studies of hierarchy browsers.}},

The interactive tool permits traversal of the abstraction tree using a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) allowing the user to view the segmented MR image or any portion thereof at the desired level of detail.

In this paper, we present an interactive segmentation framework that integrates image appearance and boundary constraints in a principled way to address this problem. In particular, we assume that small sets of pixels, which are referred to as seed pixels, are labeled as the object and background. The seed pixels are used to estimate the labels of the unlabeled pixels using Dirichlet process multiple-view learning, which leverages 1) multiple-view learning that integrates appearance and boundary constraints and 2) Dirichlet process mixture-based nonlinear classification that simultaneously models image features and discriminates between the object and background classes. With the proposed learning and inference algorithms, our segmentation framework is experimentally shown to produce both quantitatively and qualitatively promising results on a standard dataset of images. In particular, our proposed framework is able to segment whole objects from images given insufficient seeds.}},

Recently it has been shown that it is also useful for identifying concerns in source code. The tree cutting strategy plays an important role in obtaining the clusters, which identify the concerns. In this contribution the authors compare two tree cutting strategies: the Dynamic Hybrid cut and the commonly used fixed height threshold. Two case studies have been performed on the source code of Philips Healthcare to compare the results using both approaches. While some of the settings are particular to the Philips-case, the results show that applying a dynamic threshold, implemented by the Dynamic Hybrid cut, is an improvement over the fixed height threshold in the detection of clusters representing relevant concerns. This makes the approach as a whole more usable in practice.}},

We introduce a new degree of freedom to this method by allowing arbitrary minimum s-t-cuts and show that this unrestricted algorithm is complete, i.e., any clustering hierarchy based on minimum s-t-cuts can be found by choosing the right cuts. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of a graph's structure.

However, hierarchical clustering algorithms do not actually create clusters, but compute only a hierarchical representation of the data set. This makes them unsuitable as an automatic pre-processing step for other algorithms that operate on detected clusters. This is true for both dendrograms and reachability plots, which have been proposed as hierarchical clustering representations, and which have different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper we first investigate the relation between dendrograms and reachability plots and introduce methods to convert them into each other showing that they essentially contain the same information. Based on reachability plots, we then introduce a technique that automatically determines the significant clusters in a hierarchical cluster representation. This makes it for the first time possible to use hierarchical clustering as an automatic pre-processing step that requires no user interaction to select clusters from a hierarchical cluster representation.}},

@article{langfelder2008defining,
    abstract = {{Summary: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible—cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein–protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. Availability: The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting  Contact: stevitihit@yahoo.com Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

    abstract = {{Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data allow to reconstruct the 3D pathways of axons within the white matter of the brain as a tractography. The analysis of tractographies has drawn attention from the machine learning and pattern recognition communities providing novel challenges such as finding an appropriate representation space for the data. Many of the current learning algorithms require the input to be from a vectorial space. This requirement contrasts with the intrinsic nature of the tractography because its basic elements, called streamlines or tracks, have different lengths and different number of points and for this reason they cannot be directly represented in a common vectorial space. In this work we propose the adoption of the dissimilarity representation which is an Euclidean embedding technique defined by selecting a set of streamlines called prototypes and then mapping any new streamline to the vector of distances from prototypes. We investigate the degree of approximation of this projection under different prototype selection policies and prototype set sizes in order to characterise its use on tractography data. Additionally we propose the use of a scalable approximation of the most effective prototype selection policy that provides fast and accurate dissimilarity approximations of complete tractographies.}},

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indexes obtained along the corticospinal tracts distinguish ALS patients and control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging can be estimated from at least 6 diffusion-weighted images; however an acquisition scheme with a higher number of diffusion directions allows a more robust estimation of DTI indexes. The aim of the study was to establish if a higher number of diffusion encoding gradients increases the diagnostic accuracy of DTI in ALS. We studied 18 patients and 16 control subjects acquiring 2 DTI data sets with 6 and 31 gradient orientations. The mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values were measured along the corticospinal tract. Mean diffusivity in ALS was significantly increased (P = 0.026) with respect to control subjects in acquisition scheme with 31 but not (P = 0.214) with 6 diffusion-weighting directions. Fractional anisotropy was significantly lower in patients both with 6 (P = 0.0036) and with 31 (P = 0.0004) diffusion-weighting directions (0.538 vs 0.588 and 0.530 vs 0.594). Fractional anisotropy receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a higher diagnostic accuracy by using 31 diffusion-weighting direction (85.76\%) with respect to 6 directions (79.86\%). Diffusion tensor imaging confirms its potentials in diagnosing ALS with a good accuracy; the acquisition scheme with a higher diffusion-weighting directions seems to better discriminate between ALS patients and control subjects.

                In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric Bayesian framework to cluster white matter fiber tracts into bundles using a hierarchical Dirichlet processes mixture (HDPM) model. The number of clusters is automatically learned driven by data with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior instead of being manually specified. After the models of bundles have been learned from training data without supervision, they can be used as priors to cluster/classify fibers of new subjects for comparison across subjects. When clustering fibers of new subjects, new clusters can be created for structures not observed in the training data. Our approach does not require computing pairwise distances between fibers and can cluster a huge set of fibers across multiple subjects. We present results on several data sets, the largest of which has more than 120,000 fibers.

An expert rater evaluated the anatomical accuracy of the bundles. We also evaluated the method by applying an experimental cross-subject labeling method to the clustering results. We first employ a sampling and culling strategy for generating DTI integral curves and then constrain the curves so that they terminate in gray matter. We then employ a clustering method based on a proximity measure calculated between every pair of curves. We interactively selected a proximity threshold to achieve visually optimal clustering in models from four DTI datasets. An expert rater then assigned a confidence rating about bundle presence and accuracy for each of 12 target fiber bundles of varying calibers and type in each dataset. We then created a fiber bundle template to cluster and label the fiber bundles automatically in new datasets. According to expert evaluation, the automated proximity-based clustering and labeling algorithm consistently yields anatomically plausible fiber bundles on large and coherent clusters. This work has the potential to provide an automatic and robust way to find and study neural fiber bundles within DTI.}},

Domain specific distances that encodes the dissimilarity of tracts do not allow to define a positive semi-definite kernel function.We show that a dissimilarity representation based on such distances enables the successful design of a classifier.

    abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Magn Reson Med 48:577–582, 2002. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

@article{turnbull2005fast,
    abstract = {{This paper explores the automatic classification of audio tracks into musical genres. Our goal is to achieve human-level accuracy with fast training and classification. This goal is achieved with radial basis function (RBF) networks by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised initialization methods. These initialization methods yield classifiers that are as accurate as RBF networks trained with gradient descent (which is hundreds of times slower). In addition, feature subset selection further reduces training and classification time while preserving classification accuracy. Combined, our methods succeed in creating an RBF network that matches the musical classification accuracy of humans. The general algorithmic contribution of this paper is to show experimentally that RBF networks initialized with a combination of methods can yield good classification performance without relying on gradient descent. The simplicity and computational efficiency of our initialization methods produce classifiers that are fast to train as well as fast to apply to novel data. We also present an improved method for initializing the k-means clustering algorithm, which is useful for both unsupervised and supervised initialization methods.}},

@article{pekalska2006prototype,
    abstract = {{A conventional way to discriminate between objects represented by dissimilarities is the nearest neighbor method. A more efficient and sometimes a more accurate solution is offered by other dissimilarity-based classifiers. They construct a decision rule based on the entire training set, but they need just a small set of prototypes, the so-called representation set, as a reference for classifying new objects. Such alternative approaches may be especially advantageous for non-Euclidean or even non-metric dissimilarities. The choice of a proper representation set for dissimilarity-based classifiers is not yet fully investigated. It appears that a random selection may work well. In this paper, a number of experiments has been conducted on various metric and non-metric dissimilarity representations and prototype selection methods. Several procedures, like traditional feature selection methods (here effectively searching for prototypes), mode seeking and linear programming are compared to the random selection. In general, we find out that systematic approaches lead to better results than the random selection, especially for a small number of prototypes. Although there is no single winner as it depends on data characteristics, the k-centres works well, in general. For two-class problems, an important observation is that our dissimilarity-based discrimination functions relying on significantly reduced prototype sets (3–10\% of the training objects) offer a similar or much better classification accuracy than the best k-NN rule on the entire training set. This may be reached for multi-class data as well, however such problems are more difficult.}},

If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values.}},

While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations. In this review we therefore assess the basic principles and the assumptions that need to be made for each step of the study, including both data acquisition and the elaborate fiber reconstruction algorithms.

We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.}},
