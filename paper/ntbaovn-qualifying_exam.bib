Our approach aims to construct a hierarchy that satisfies homogeneity and monotonicity properties. Working in a bottom-up fashion, a new instance is placed in the hierarchy and a sequence of hierarchy restructuring processes is performed only in regions that have been affected by the presence of the new instance. The experimental results on a variety of domains demonstrate that our algorithm is not sensitive to input ordering, can produce a quality cluster hierarchy, and is efficient in terms of computational time.}},

As a solution we present a simple, compact, tailor-made clustering algorithm, QuickBundles (QB), that overcomes the complexity of these large data sets and provides informative clusters in seconds. Each QB cluster can be represented by a single centroid streamline; collectively these centroid streamlines can be taken as an effective representation of the tractography.

Our method can be seen as a compressing operation, capturing the most meaningful information enclosed in the fiber dataset. For the sake of efficiency, part of the analysis is based on clustering the white matter (WM) voxels rather than the fibers. The resulting regions of interest are used to define subset of fibers that are subdivided further into consistent bundles using a clustering of the fiber extremities. The dataset is reduced from more than one million fiber tracts to about two thousand fiber bundles. Validations are provided using simulated data and a physical phantom. We see our approach as a crucial preprocessing step before further analysis of huge fiber datasets. An important application will be the inference of detailed models of the subdivisions of white matter pathways and the mapping of the main U-fiber bundles.}},

However, in many practical problems, the selection of a representative level (partition) in the hierarchy is needed. The classical approach to do so is by using a cluster validity index to select the best partition according to the criterion imposed by this index. In this paper, we present a new approach based on the clustering ensemble philosophy. The representative level is defined here as the consensus partition in the hierarchy. In the consensus computation process, we take into account the similarity between partitions and information from the evaluation of partitions with different cluster validity indexes. An experimental comparison on several datasets shows the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to the classical approach.}},

DTI also allows us to approximate the 3D trajectories of major white matter bundles. By combining the identified tract coordinates with various types of MR parameter maps, such as T 2  and diffusion properties, we can perform tract-specific analysis of these parameters. Unfortunately, 3D tract reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume effects, and complicated axonal structures. Furthermore, changes in diffusion anisotropy under pathological conditions could alter the results of 3D tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the DTI data from 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were performed. Excellent correlation was found between the automated and the individual tractography-based results. This tool allows efficient initial screening of the status of multiple white matter tracts.}},

We demonstrate that our atlas creation method, which is based on group spectral clustering of tractography, discovers structures corresponding to expected white matter anatomy such as the corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundles, arcuate fasciculus, and corona radiata. The white matter clusters are augmented with expert anatomical labels and stored in a new type of atlas that we call a high-dimensional white matter atlas. We then show how to perform automatic segmentation of tractography from novel subjects by extending the spectral clustering solution, stored in the atlas, using the Nystrom method. We present results regarding the stability of our method and parameter choices. Finally we give results from an atlas creation and automatic segmentation experiment. We demonstrate that our automatic tractography segmentation identifies corresponding white matter regions across hemispheres and across subjects, enabling group comparison of white matter anatomy.

Many of the current learning algorithms require the input to be from a vectorial space. This requirement contrasts with the intrinsic nature of the tractography because its basic elements, called streamlines or tracks, have different lengths and different number of points and for this reason they cannot be directly represented in a common vectorial space. In this work we propose the adoption of the dissimilarity representation which is an Euclidean embedding technique defined by selecting a set of streamlines called prototypes and then mapping any new streamline to the vector of distances from prototypes. We investigate the degree of approximation of this projection under different prototype selection policies and prototype set sizes in order to characterise its use on tractography data. Additionally we propose the use of a scalable approximation of the most effective prototype selection policy that provides fast and accurate dissimilarity approximations of complete tractographies.}},

However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences---generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to find implicit correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classification and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and significantly more efficient than current approaches.}},

In this paper we propose a class of kernels for sets of vectors directly exploiting set distance measures and, hence, incorporating various semantics into set kernels and lending the power of regularization to learning in structural domains where natural distance functions exist. These kernels belong to two groups: (i) kernels in the proximity space induced by set distances and (ii) set distance substitution kernels (non-PSD in general). We report experimental results which show that our kernels compare favorably with kernels based on averaging and achieve results similar to other state-of-the-art methods.

Actually, it is a technique that produces in vivo images of biological tissues by exploiting the constrained diffusion properties of water molecules. In neuroscience, dMRI is used to the extraction of neuronal fibers from brain DMRI and it offers a good look into brain micro-structure at a scale that is not easily accessible with other modalities, in some cases improving the detection and characterization of white matter abnormalities. Because of that, dMRI can help understand brain connectivity deeply. This has lead to numerous beneficial in both diagnosis and clinical applications. However, optimal utilization of the widerange of data provided by many directional diffusion dMRI measurements requires careful attention to acquisition and preprocessing. This article will review the preprocessing of dMRI data inlcuding these main steps: reconstruction, tracking and coregistration. The outcome after these steps is the tractography of the whole brain from discrete measured diffusion tensor MRI data. The tractography is also registered in world space which makes it easy to view in any visulization tool. The implementation is done with the help from Dipy (Diffusion Imaging in Python) package, and FSL is used for visualization.}},

                With the increasing importance of fiber tracking in diffusion tensor images for clinical needs, there has been a growing demand for an objective mathematical framework to perform quantitative analysis of white matter fiber bundles incorporating their underlying physical significance. This article presents such a novel mathematical framework that facilitates mathematical operations between tracts using an inner product between fibres. Such inner product operation, based on Gaussian processes, spans a metric space. This metric facilitates combination of fiber tracts, rendering operations like tract membership to a bundle or bundle similarity simple. Based on this framework, we have designed an automated unsupervised atlas-based clustering method that does not require manual initialization nor an a priori knowledge of the number of clusters. Quantitative analysis can now be performed on the clustered tract volumes across subjects, thereby avoiding the need for point parameterization of these fibers, or the use of medial or envelope representations as in previous work. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the mathematical operations. Subsequently, the applicability of the unsupervised clustering framework has been demonstrated on a 21-subject dataset.

This work is motivated by medical applications in which variation analysis of known bundles of fiber tracts in the human brain is desired. To include the anatomical knowledge in the clustering, we invoke an atlas of fiber tracts, labeled by the number of bundles of interest. In this work, we construct such an atlas and use it to cluster all fiber tracts in the white matter. To build the atlas, we start with a set of labeled ROIs specified by an expert and extract the fiber tracts initiating from each ROI. Affine registration is used to project the extracted fiber tracts of each subject to the atlas, whereas their B-spline representation is used to efficiently compare them to the fiber tracts in the atlas and assign cluster labels. Expert visual inspection of the result confirms that the proposed method is very promising and efficient in clustering of the known bundles of fiber tracts.}},

    abstract = {{White matter fiber bundles of the human brain form a spatial pattern defined by the anatomical and functional architecture. Tractography applied to the tensor field in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results in sets of streamlines which can be associated with major fiber tracts. Comparison of fiber tract properties across subjects needs comparison at corresponding anatomical locations. Moreover, clinical analysis studying fiber tract disruption and integrity requires analysis along tracts and within cross-sections, which is hard to accomplish by conventional region of interest and voxel-based analysis. We propose a new framework for MR DTI analysis that includes tractography, fiber clustering, alignment via local shape parametrization and diffusion analysis across and along tracts. Feasibility is shown with the uncinate fasciculus and the cortico-spinal tracts. The extended set of features including fiber tract geometry and diffusion properties might lead to an improved understanding of diffusion properties and its association to normal/abnormal brain development.}},

We formulate the atlas creation as a maximum likelihood problem which the proposed method solves using a generalized Expectation Maximization (EM) framework. Additionally, the algorithm employs an outlier rejection and denoising strategy to produce sharp probabilistic maps of certain bundles of interest. We test this algorithm on synthetic and real data, and evaluate its stability against initialization. We demonstrate labeling a novel subject using the resulting spatial atlas and evaluate the accuracy of this labeling. Consistency clustering is a viable tool for completely automatic white-matter atlas construction for sub-populations and the resulting atlas is potentially useful for making diffusion measurements in a common coordinate system to identify pathology related changes or developmental trends.}},

    abstract = {{
                Normal and abnormal brains can be segmented by registering the target image with an atlas. Here, an atlas is defined as the combination of an intensity image (template) and its segmented image (the atlas labels). After registering the atlas template and the target image, the atlas labels are propagated to the target image. We define this process as atlas-based segmentation. In recent years, researchers have investigated registration algorithms to match atlases to query subjects and also strategies for atlas construction. In this paper we present a review of the automated approaches for atlas-based segmentation of magnetic resonance brain images. We aim to point out the strengths and weaknesses of atlas-based methods and suggest new research directions. We use two different criteria to present the methods. First, we refer to the algorithms according to their atlas-based strategy: label propagation, multi-atlas methods, and probabilistic techniques. Subsequently, we classify the methods according to their medical target: the brain and its internal structures, tissue segmentation in healthy subjects, tissue segmentation in fetus, neonates and elderly subjects, and segmentation of damaged brains. A quantitative comparison of the results reported in the literature is also presented.

The method is based on a multi-subject bundle atlas derived from a two-level intra-subject and inter-subject clustering strategy. This atlas is a model of the brain white matter organization, computed for a group of subjects, made up of a set of generic fiber bundles that can be detected in most of the population. Each atlas bundle corresponds to several inter-subject clusters manually labeled to account for subdivisions of the underlying pathways often presenting large variability across subjects. An atlas bundle is represented by the multi-subject list of the centroids of all intra-subject clusters in order to get a good sampling of the shape and localization variability. The atlas, composed of 36 known deep white matter bundles and 47 superficial white matter bundles in each hemisphere, was inferred from a first database of 12 brains. It was successfully used to segment the deep white matter bundles in a second database of 20 brains and most of the superficial white matter bundles in 10 subjects of the same database. \^{a}º We propose an automatic and robust method for fiber bundle segmentation in massive tractography datasets. \^{a}º The method is based on a novel HARDI multi-subject human brain fiber bundle atlas, composed of 36 known deep white matter bundles. \^{a}º The atlas also contains 47 superficial white matter bundles in each hemisphere, included in a multisubject bundle atlas for the first time. \^{a}º The method considers the fiber shape, position and length information in the segmentation, leading to better results than ROI-based approaches. \^{a}º Results can be used for population studies where each generic bundle is analyzed separately.}},

    abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the extent and the nature of white matter tissue damage of patients with Alzheimer's disease using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI).Background: Although Alzheimer's disease pathology mainly affects cortical grey matter, previous pathological and MRI studies showed that also the brain white matter of patients is damaged. However, the nature of Alzheimer's disease associated white matter damage is still unclear.Methods: Conventional and DT-MRI scans were obtained from16 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 10 sex and age matched healthy volunteers. The mean diffusivity (D̅), fractional anisotropy (FA), and inter-voxel coherence (C) of several white matter regions were measured.Results: D̅ was higher and FA lower in the corpus callosum, as well as in the white matter of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in the corresponding regions from healthy controls. D̅ and FA of the white matter of the occipital lobe and internal capsule were not different between patients and controls. C values were also not different between patients and controls for any of the regions studied. Strong correlations were found between the mini mental state examination score and the average overall white matter D̅ (r=0.92, p<0.001) and FA (r=0.78; p<0.001).Conclusions: White matter changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease are likely to be secondary to wallerian degeneration of fibre tracts due to neuronal loss in cortical associative areas.}},

An expert rater evaluated the anatomical accuracy of the bundles. We also evaluated the method by applying an experimental cross-subject labeling method to the clustering results. We first employ a sampling and culling strategy for generating DTI integral curves and then constrain the curves so that they terminate in gray matter. We then employ a clustering method based on a proximity measure calculated between every pair of curves. We interactively selected a proximity threshold to achieve visually optimal clustering in models from four DTI datasets. An expert rater then assigned a confidence rating about bundle presence and accuracy for each of 12 target fiber bundles of varying calibers and type in each dataset. We then created a fiber bundle template to cluster and label the fiber bundles automatically in new datasets. According to expert evaluation, the automated proximity-based clustering and labeling algorithm consistently yields anatomically plausible fiber bundles on large and coherent clusters.

We report a case study based on a dataset where for each tractography of three subjects the segmentation of eight major anatomical tracts was manually operated by expert neuroanatomists. Domain specific distances that encodes the dissimilarity of tracts do not allow to define a positive semi-definite kernel function.We show that a dissimilarity representation based on such distances enables the successful design of a classifier. This approach provides a robust encoding which proves to be effective using a linear classifier.

    abstract = {{Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Magn Reson Med 48:577–582, 2002. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

@article{turnbull2005fast,
    abstract = {{This paper explores the automatic classification of audio tracks into musical genres. Our goal is to achieve human-level accuracy with fast training and classification. This goal is achieved with radial basis function (RBF) networks by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised initialization methods. These initialization methods yield classifiers that are as accurate as RBF networks trained with gradient descent (which is hundreds of times slower). In addition, feature subset selection further reduces training and classification time while preserving classification accuracy. Combined, our methods succeed in creating an RBF network that matches the musical classification accuracy of humans. The general algorithmic contribution of this paper is to show experimentally that RBF networks initialized with a combination of methods can yield good classification performance without relying on gradient descent. The simplicity and computational efficiency of our initialization methods produce classifiers that are fast to train as well as fast to apply to novel data. We also present an improved method for initializing the k-means clustering algorithm, which is useful for both unsupervised and supervised initialization methods.}},

If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values.}},

@article{balcan2008theory,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in machine learning, with an attractive theory as well. This theory views a kernel as implicitly mapping data points into a possibly very high dimensional space, and describes a kernel function as being good for a given learning problem if data is separable by a large margin in that implicit space. However, while quite elegant, this theory does not necessarily correspond to the intuition of a good kernel as a good measure of similarity, and the underlying margin in the implicit space usually is not apparent in  ” natural” representations of the data. Therefore, it may be difficult for a domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the learning task at hand. Moreover, the requirement of positive semi-definiteness may rule out the most natural pairwise similarity functions for the given problem domain. In this work we develop an alternative, more general theory of learning with similarity functions (i.e., sufficient conditions for a similarity function to allow one to learn well) that does not require reference to implicit spaces, and does not require the function to be positive semi-definite (or even symmetric). Instead, our theory talks in terms of more direct properties of how the function behaves as a similarity measure. Our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good kernel function under the usual definition can be shown to also be a good similarity function under our definition (though with some loss in the parameters). In this way, we provide the first steps towards a theory of kernels and more general similarity functions that describes the effectiveness of a given function in terms of natural similarity-based properties.}},

While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations.

                This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.
