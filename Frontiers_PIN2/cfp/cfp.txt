*** Research Topic Abstract ***

Frontiers in Neuroinformatics hosted the research topic â€œPython in
Neuroscienceâ€ in 2008-2009 [1], documenting the first wave of mature
tools to propel Python into common use in the field. This widespread
convergence on Python as the systems integration language of choice in
neuroscience has brought with it exciting new possibilities for
cross-fertilization, collaboration, and interdisciplinary interaction.

The Python ecosystem remains vibrant and inventive, and continues to
produce cutting edge tools for neuroscience research. With this second
research topic on â€œPython in Neuroscienceâ€ we seek to showcase the most
exciting developments since 2009 that include, but are not limited to,
the following themes:

- interactive simulation and visualization
- workflows and automation
- brain-machine interfaces
- advances in neuroimaging analysis methods
- sharing, re-use, storage and databasing of models and data
- data analysis libraries and frameworks
- brain atlasing, ontologies, semantic web
- model description and abstraction languages

We invite contributions that promote innovative use of Python for
scientific work from any branch of neuroscience.

This research topic is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr. Rolf
Koetter, visionary, colleague and friend.

*** Submission Procedure ***

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before April
7th, 2013 a max. 1 page abstract/outline of work related to the focus
of the research topic to python.in.neuroscience@gmail.com for
consideration for inclusion as an elaborated full article in the
research topic.

Please include a provisional title, a full author list, and format the
subject of your email as follows: "[python RT] outline - Your Name".

Authors will be notified whether their contribution has been accepted
by April 21st, 2013.


*** Full Article Information ***

* Full articles will be solicited based on the abstracts/outlines we
receive by April 7th, 2013.

* The deadline for submission of full articles will be July 15, 2013.

* Manuscripts should be clearly different from user manuals or web
pages. Rather they should focus on the underlying concepts and
innovations in architecture, algorithms, data-structures, workflows,
etc.

* The research topic is co-hosted by Frontiers in Neuroinformatics and
Frontiers in Brain Imaging Methods. Authors choose the journal which
is named when citing their article (Front. Neuroinformatics or Front.
Brain Imaging Methods) by submitting the full article to the
respective journal. All research topic articles will be listed in
the research topic page appearing in both journals.

* Article formatting will be as for standard Frontiers "Original
Research", â€œMethodsâ€ or â€œReviewâ€ articles. Guidelines and instructions
for their preparation can be found at
http://www.frontiersin.org/about/AuthorGuidelines

* Frontiers in Neuroinformatics and Frontiers in Brain Imaging Methods
are open access journals, following a pay-for-publication model.
Research Topic articles enjoy a generous discount, thanks to the
support of the Frontiers Research Foundation. Details of the
publication fees can be found at
http://www.frontiersin.org/about/PublishingFees.

* Further details will be provided to authors of accepted abstracts by
April 21st, 2013.
