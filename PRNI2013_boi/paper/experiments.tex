Report timings for the actual dissimilarity projection of the entire
tractography and the timing of SFF.

Table: timing to cluster a given set of streamlines, i.e. at different
steps of the iterative refinement: 300K, 20K, 5K, 1K...

\subsection{ALS Dataset}
Brief description of the dataset.

\subsection{Example}
Sequence of pictures from the initial tractography to the segmented
cortico-spinal tract (CTS).

Another image to compare a patient's CTS vs. a healthy subject CTS.

Add a note to mention about the average amount of time to segment a
CTS in a given subject (5 minutes?).

Add a table about the number of clusters (selected/shown) and the
related number of streamlines addressed, at each iteration of the
segmentation process. Like (3/300)->(5000/300000),
(10/15)->(4000/5000), etc.

Mention DiPy and related URLs.

Mention this is an open-source project.
