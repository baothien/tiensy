In this report we compare 5 different algorithms for constructing balltrees from data. We study the trade-off between construction time and the quality of the constructed tree. Two of the algorithms are on-line, two construct the structures from the data set in a top down fashion, and one uses a bottom up approach. We empirically study the algorithms on random data drawn from eight different probability distributions representing smooth, clustered, and curve distributed data in different ambient space dimensions. We find that the bottom up approach usually produces the best trees but has the longest construction time. The other approaches have uses in specific circumstances. 1}},

    abstract = {{The k-means method is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms, drawing its popularity from its speed in practice. Recently, however, it was shown to have exponential worst-case running time. In order to close the gap between practical performance and theoretical analysis, the k-means method has been studied in the model of smoothed analysis. But even the smoothed analyses so far are unsatisfactory as the bounds are still super-polynomial in the number n of data points. In this paper, we settle the smoothed running time of the k-means method. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is bounded by a polynomial in n and 1/sigma, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations. This means that if an arbitrary input data set is randomly perturbed, then the k-means method will run in expected polynomial time on that input set.}},

The K-Means algorithm can be described either as a gradient descent algorithm or by slightly extending the mathematics of the EM algorithm to this hard threshold case. We show that the K-Means algorithm actually minimizes the quantization error using the very fast Newton algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION  K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in many applications, including the initialization of more computationally expensive algorithms (Gaussian mixtures, Radial Basis Functions, Learning Vector Quantization and some Hidden Markov Models). The practice of this initialization procedure often gives the frustrating feeling that K-Means performs most of the task in a small fraction of the overall time. This motivated us to better understand this convergence speed. A second reason lies in the traditional debate between hard threshold (e.g. KMeans, Viterbi Training) and soft threshold (e.g. Gaussia...}},

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indexes obtained along the corticospinal tracts distinguish ALS patients and control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging can be estimated from at least 6 diffusion-weighted images; however an acquisition scheme with a higher number of diffusion directions allows a more robust estimation of DTI indexes. The aim of the study was to establish if a higher number of diffusion encoding gradients increases the diagnostic accuracy of DTI in ALS. We studied 18 patients and 16 control subjects acquiring 2 DTI data sets with 6 and 31 gradient orientations. The mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values were measured along the corticospinal tract. Mean diffusivity in ALS was significantly increased (P = 0.026) with respect to control subjects in acquisition scheme with 31 but not (P = 0.214) with 6 diffusion-weighting directions. Fractional anisotropy was significantly lower in patients both with 6 (P = 0.0036) and with 31 (P = 0.0004) diffusion-weighting directions (0.538 vs 0.588 and 0.530 vs 0.594). Fractional anisotropy receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a higher diagnostic accuracy by using 31 diffusion-weighting direction (85.76\%) with respect to 6 directions (79.86\%). Diffusion tensor imaging confirms its potentials in diagnosing ALS with a good accuracy; the acquisition scheme with a higher diffusion-weighting directions seems to better discriminate between ALS patients and control subjects.

                Voxel-based analyses (VBA) are increasingly being used to detect white matter abnormalities with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in different types of pathologies. However, the validity, specificity, and sensitivity of statistical inferences of group differences to a large extent depend on the quality of the spatial normalization of the DTI images. Using high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration techniques that are able to align both the spatial and orientational diffusion information and incorporate appropriate templates that contain this complete DT information may improve this quality. Alternatively, a hybrid technique such as tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) may improve the reliability of the statistical results by generating voxel-wise statistics without the need for perfect image alignment and spatial smoothing. In this study, we have used (1) a coregistration algorithm that was optimized for coregistration of DTI data and (2) a population-based DTI atlas to reanalyze our previously published VBA, which compared the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with those of healthy controls. Additionally, we performed a complementary TBSS analysis to improve our understanding and interpretation of the VBA results. We demonstrate that, as the overall variance of the diffusion properties is lowered after normalizing the DTI data with such recently developed techniques (VBA using our own optimized high-dimensional nonrigid coregistration and TBSS), more reliable voxel-wise statistical results can be obtained than had previously been possible, with our VBA and TBSS yielding very similar results. This study provides support for the view of ALS as a multisystem disease, in which the entire frontotemporal lobe is implicated.

This goal is achieved with radial basis function (RBF) networks by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised initialization methods. These initialization methods yield classifiers that are as accurate as RBF networks trained with gradient descent (which is hundreds of times slower). In addition, feature subset selection further reduces training and classification time while preserving classification accuracy. Combined, our methods succeed in creating an RBF network that matches the musical classification accuracy of humans. The general algorithmic contribution of this paper is to show experimentally that RBF networks initialized with a combination of methods can yield good classification performance without relying on gradient descent. The simplicity and computational efficiency of our initialization methods produce classifiers that are fast to train as well as fast to apply to novel data. We also present an improved method for initializing the k-means clustering algorithm, which is useful for both unsupervised and supervised initialization methods.}},

However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Magn Reson Med 48:577â582, 2002. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.}},

    abstract = {{A conventional way to discriminate between objects represented by dissimilarities is the nearest neighbor method. A more efficient and sometimes a more accurate solution is offered by other dissimilarity-based classifiers. They construct a decision rule based on the entire training set, but they need just a small set of prototypes, the so-called representation set, as a reference for classifying new objects. Such alternative approaches may be especially advantageous for non-Euclidean or even non-metric dissimilarities. The choice of a proper representation set for dissimilarity-based classifiers is not yet fully investigated. It appears that a random selection may work well. In this paper, a number of experiments has been conducted on various metric and non-metric dissimilarity representations and prototype selection methods. Several procedures, like traditional feature selection methods (here effectively searching for prototypes), mode seeking and linear programming are compared to the random selection. In general, we find out that systematic approaches lead to better results than the random selection, especially for a small number of prototypes. Although there is no single winner as it depends on data characteristics, the k-centres works well, in general. For two-class problems, an important observation is that our dissimilarity-based discrimination functions relying on significantly reduced prototype sets (3â10\% of the training objects) offer a similar or much better classification accuracy than the best k-NN rule on the entire training set. This may be reached for multi-class data as well, however such problems are more difficult.}},

    abstract = {{We present a method for clustering diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) integral curves into anatomically plausible bundles. An expert rater evaluated the anatomical accuracy of the bundles. We also evaluated the method by applying an experimental cross-subject labeling method to the clustering results. We first employ a sampling and culling strategy for generating DTI integral curves and then constrain the curves so that they terminate in gray matter. We then employ a clustering method based on a proximity measure calculated between every pair of curves. We interactively selected a proximity threshold to achieve visually optimal clustering in models from four DTI datasets. An expert rater then assigned a confidence rating about bundle presence and accuracy for each of 12 target fiber bundles of varying calibers and type in each dataset. We then created a fiber bundle template to cluster and label the fiber bundles automatically in new datasets. According to expert evaluation, the automated proximity-based clustering and labeling algorithm consistently yields anatomically plausible fiber bundles on large and coherent clusters. This work has the potential to provide an automatic and robust way to find and study neural fiber bundles within DTI.}},

    abstract = {{
                In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric Bayesian framework to cluster white matter fiber tracts into bundles using a hierarchical Dirichlet processes mixture (HDPM) model. The number of clusters is automatically learned driven by data with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior instead of being manually specified. After the models of bundles have been learned from training data without supervision, they can be used as priors to cluster/classify fibers of new subjects for comparison across subjects. When clustering fibers of new subjects, new clusters can be created for structures not observed in the training data. Our approach does not require computing pairwise distances between fibers and can cluster a huge set of fibers across multiple subjects. We present results on several data sets, the largest of which has more than 120,000 fibers.

    abstract = {{Usually, objects to be classified are represented by features. In this paper, we discuss an alternative object representation based on dissimilarity values. If such distances separate the classes well, the nearest neighbor method offers a good solution. However, dissimilarities used in practice are usually far from ideal and the performance of the nearest neighbor rule suffers from its sensitivity to noisy examples. We show that other, more global classification techniques are preferable to the nearest neighbor rule, in such cases.For classification purposes, two different ways of using generalized dissimilarity kernels are considered. In the first one, distances are isometrically embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space and the classification task is performed there. In the second approach, classifiers are built directly on distance kernels. Both approaches are described theoretically and then compared using experiments with different dissimilarity measures and datasets including degraded data simulating the problem of missing values.}},

                This work describes a reproducibility analysis of scalar water diffusion parameters, measured within white matter tracts segmented using a probabilistic shape modelling method. In common with previously reported neighbourhood tractography (NT) work, the technique optimises seed point placement for fibre tracking by matching the tracts generated using a number of candidate points against a reference tract, which is derived from a white matter atlas in the present study. No direct constraints are applied to the fibre tracking results. An Expectation-Maximisation algorithm is used to fully automate the procedure, and make dramatically more efficient use of data than earlier NT methods. Within-subject and between-subject variances for fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity within the tracts are then separated using a random effects model. We find test-retest coefficients of variation (CVs) similar to those reported in another study using landmark-guided single seed points; and subject to subject CVs similar to a constraint-based multiple ROI method. We conclude that our approach is at least as effective as other methods for tract segmentation using tractography, whilst also having some additional benefits, such as its provision of a goodness-of-match measure for each segmentation.
