    abstract = {{Quantitative measurement of brain size, shape, and temporal change (for example, in order to estimate atrophy) is increasingly important in biomedical image analysis applications. New methods of structural analysis attempt to improve robustness, accuracy, and extent of automation. A fully automated method of longitudinal (temporal change) analysis, SIENA, was presented previously. In this paper, improvements to this method are described, and also an extension of SIENA to a new method for cross-sectional (single time point) analysis. The methods are fully automated, robust, and accurate: 0.15\% brain volume change error (longitudinal): 0.5–1\% brain volume accuracy for single-time point (cross-sectional). A particular advantage is the relative insensitivity to differences in scanning parameters. The methods provide easy manual review of their output by the automatic production of summary images which show the results of the brain extraction, registration, tissue segmentation, and final atrophy estimation. }},

                Diffusion tensor tractography is increasingly used to examine structural connectivity in the brain in various conditions, but its test-retest reliability is understudied. The main purposes of this study were to evaluate 1) the reliability of quantitative measurements of diffusion tensor tractography and 2) the effect on reliability of the number of gradient sampling directions and scan repetition. Images were acquired from ten healthy participants. Ten fiber regions of nine major fiber tracts were reconstructed and quantified using six fiber variables. Intra- and inter-session reliabilities were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV), and were compared to pinpoint major error sources. Additional pairwise comparisons were made between the reliability of images with 30 directions and NEX 2 (DTI30-2), 30 directions and NEX 1 (DTI30-1), and 15 directions and NEX 2 (DTI15-2) to determine whether increasing gradient directions and scan repetition improved reliability. Of the 60 tractography measurements, 43 showed intersession CV ≤ 10\%, ICC ≥ .70, or both for DTI30-2, 40 measurements for DTI30-1, and 37 for DTI15-2. Most of the reliable measurements were associated with the tracts corpus callosum, cingulum, cerebral peduncular fibers, uncinate fasciculus, and arcuate fasciculus. These reliable measurements included factional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity of all 10 fiber regions. Intersession reliability was significantly worse than intra-session reliability for FA, mean length, and tract volume measurements from DTI15-2, indicating that the combination of MRI signal variation and physiological noise/change over time was the major error source for this sequence. Increasing the number of gradient directions from 15 to 30 while controlling the scan time, significantly affected values for all six variables and reduced intersession variability for mean length and tract volume measurements. Additionally, while increasing scan repetition from 1 to 2 had no significant effect on the reliability for DTI with 30 directions, this significantly reduced the upward bias in FA values from all 10 fiber regions and fiber count, mean length, and tract volume measurements from 5 to 7 fiber regions. In conclusion, diffusion tensor tractography provided many measurements with high test-retest reliability across different fiber variables and various fiber tracts even for images with 15 directions (NEX 2). Increasing the number of gradient directions from 15 to 30 with equivalent scan time reduced variability whereas increasing repetition from 1 to 2 for 30-direction DTI improved the accuracy of tractography measurements.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indexes obtained along the corticospinal tracts distinguish ALS patients and control subjects. Diffusion tensor imaging can be estimated from at least 6 diffusion-weighted images; however an acquisition scheme with a higher number of diffusion directions allows a more robust estimation of DTI indexes. The aim of the study was to establish if a higher number of diffusion encoding gradients increases the diagnostic accuracy of DTI in ALS. We studied 18 patients and 16 control subjects acquiring 2 DTI data sets with 6 and 31 gradient orientations. The mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values were measured along the corticospinal tract. Mean diffusivity in ALS was significantly increased (P = 0.026) with respect to control subjects in acquisition scheme with 31 but not (P = 0.214) with 6 diffusion-weighting directions. Fractional anisotropy was significantly lower in patients both with 6 (P = 0.0036) and with 31 (P = 0.0004) diffusion-weighting directions (0.538 vs 0.588 and 0.530 vs 0.594). Fractional anisotropy receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a higher diagnostic accuracy by using 31 diffusion-weighting direction (85.76\%) with respect to 6 directions (79.86\%). Diffusion tensor imaging confirms its potentials in diagnosing ALS with a good accuracy; the acquisition scheme with a higher diffusion-weighting directions seems to better discriminate between ALS patients and control subjects.

    abstract = {{Performance evaluation of multi-target tracking algorithms is of great practical importance in the design, parameter optimization and comparison of tracking systems. The goal of performance evaluation is to measure the distance between two sets of tracks: the ground truth tracks and the set of estimated tracks. This paper proposes a mathematically rigorous metric for this purpose. The basis of the proposed distance measure is the recently formulated consistent metric for performance evaluation of multi-target filters, referred to as the OSPA metric. Multi-target filters sequentially estimate the number of targets and their position in the state space. The OSPA metric is therefore defined on the space of finite sets of vectors. The distinction between filtering and tracking is that tracking algorithms output tracks and a track represents a labeled temporal sequence of state estimates, associated with the same target. The metric proposed in this paper is therefore defined on the space of finite sets of tracks and incorporates the labeling error. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed metric behaves in a manner consistent with our expectations.}},

In particular, to generate this similarity measure, the chamfer or Hausdorff distance is initially employed as a local distance metric to construct minimum spanning trees between pairwise fiber tracts. These minimum spanning trees are effective in capturing the intrinsic geometry of the fiber tracts. Hence, they are used to capture the neighborhood structures of the fiber tract data set. We next assume the high-dimensional input fiber tracts to lie on low-dimensional non-linear manifolds. We apply Locally Linear Embedding, a popular manifold learning technique, to define a low-dimensional embedding of the fiber tracts that preserves the neighborhood structures of the high-dimensional data structure as captured by the method of dual-rooted graphs. Clustering is then performed on this low-dimensional data structure using the k-means algorithm. We illustrate our resulting clustering technique on both synthetic data and on real fiber tract data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging.}},

                A number of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging techniques have been evaluated in the research setting to assess upper motor neuron (UMN) damage in ALS. Changes in tissue structure in the CNS modify the diffusional behavior of water molecules, which can be detected by diffusion tensor MRI.
                To explore the hypothesis that degeneration of the motor fibers in ALS would be reflected by changes in the diffusion characteristics of the white matter fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and that these changes could be detected by diffusion tensor MRI.
                We studied 22 patients with El Escorial definite, probable, or possible ALS-11 with limb onset (mean age 54.5 +/- 10.7 years) and 11 with bulbar onset (mean age 49.6 +/- 11.7 years)-and compared them with 20 healthy, age-matched controls (mean age 46.0 +/- 12.6 years). We assessed central motor conduction time (CMCT), threshold to stimulation, and silent period using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Diffusion tensor MRI was performed using a 1.5-T GE Signa system (Milwaukee, WI) fitted with Advanced NMR hardware and software capable of producing echo planar MR images. Data were acquired from seven coronal slices centered to include the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Maps of the mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and T2-weighted signal intensity were generated.
                There were no differences between the subject groups on measures of CMCT, threshold to stimulation, and silent period. However, the CMCT correlated with clinical measures of UMN involvement. We found a significant increase in the mean diffusivity and reduction in fractional anisotropy along the corticospinal tracts between the three subject groups, most marked in the bulbar-onset group. The fractional anisotropy correlated with measures of disease severity and UMN involvement, whereas the mean diffusivity correlated with disease duration.
                The results support the use of diffusion tensor MRI in detecting pathology of the corticospinal tracts in ALS.

In this paper, we present a framework for "batch mode active learning" that applies the Fisher information matrix to select a number of informative examples simultaneously. The key computational challenge is how to efficiently identify the subset of unlabeled examples that can result in the largest reduction in the Fisher information. To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm that is based on the property of submodular functions.

                Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is frequently considered to be a good target for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions of AD. Recent emergence of reliable network characterization techniques has made it possible to understand neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level. Accordingly, we propose an effective network-based multivariate classification algorithm, using a collection of measures derived from white matter (WM) connectivity networks, to accurately identify MCI patients from normal controls. An enriched description of WM connections, utilizing six physiological parameters, i.e., fiber count, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and principal diffusivities(λ(1), λ(2), and λ(3)), results in six connectivity networks for each subject to account for the connection topology and the biophysical properties of the connections. Upon parcellating the brain into 90 regions-of-interest (ROIs), these properties can be quantified for each pair of regions with common traversing fibers. For building an MCI classifier, clustering coefficient of each ROI in relation to the remaining ROIs is extracted as feature for classification. These features are then ranked according to their Pearson correlation with respect to the clinical labels, and are further sieved to select the most discriminant subset of features using an SVM-based feature selection algorithm. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) are trained using the selected subset of features. Classification accuracy was evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure generalization of performance. The classification accuracy given by our enriched description of WM connections is 88.9\%, which is an increase of at least 14.8\% from that using simple WM connectivity description with any single physiological parameter. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance shows an area of 0.929 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. It was also found, based on the selected features, that portions of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, parietal lobe and insula regions provided the most discriminant features for classification, in line with results reported in previous studies. Our MCI classification framework, especially the enriched description of WM connections, allows accurate early detection of brain abnormalities, which is of paramount importance for treatment management of potential AD patients.

    abstract = {{
                Characterizing the performance of image segmentation approaches has been a persistent challenge. Performance analysis is important since segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision. Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task. The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.

    abstract = {{Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a syndrome widely considered to be prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Accurate diagnosis of aMCI would enable earlier treatment, and could thus help minimize the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging-based automated classification schema for identifying aMCI. This was carried out in a sample of community-dwelling adults aged 70–90 years old: 79 with a clinical diagnosis of aMCI and 204 who were cognitively normal. Our schema was novel in using measures of both spatial atrophy, derived from T1-weighted images, and white matter alterations, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Subcortical volumetric features were extracted using a FreeSurfer-initialized Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (FS + LDDMM) segmentation approach, and fractional anisotropy (FA) values obtained for white matter regions of interest. Features were ranked by their ability to discriminate between aMCI and normal cognition, and a support vector machine (SVM) selected an optimal feature subset that was used to train SVM classifiers. As evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation, the classification performance characteristics achieved by our schema were: accuracy, 71.09\%; sensitivity, 51.96\%; specificity, 78.40\%; and area under the curve, 0.7003. Additionally, we identified numerous socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and other factors potentially implicated in the misclassification of individuals by our schema and those previously used by others. Given its high level of performance, our classification schema could facilitate the early detection of aMCI in community-dwelling elderly adults. \^{a}º Amnestic mild cognitive impairment is identified using neuroimaging. \^{a}º A combination of gray and white matter features is used. \^{a}º The method is evaluated in community-dwelling elderly individuals. \^{a}º Excellent classification performance characteristics are achieved. \^{a}º Socio-demographic, lifestyle and health factors help explain misclassifications.}},

Ninety percent diagnostic accuracy was achieved, using cross-validation, for 30 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Retrospective evaluation of serial scans obtained during prior years revealed gradual increases in structural abnormality for the MCI group, often before clinical symptoms, but slower increase for individuals remaining cognitively normal.

This has resulted in the opportunity to detect cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), small hemorrhages in the brain that are known to be associated with risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral bleeding. Currently, no computerized method is available for fully- or semi-automated detection of CMBs.
In this paper, we propose a CAD system for the detection of CMBs to speed up visual analysis in population-based studies. Our method consists
of three steps: (i) skull-stripping (ii) initial candidate selection (iii) reduction of false-positives using a two layer classication and (iv) determining the anatomical location of CMBs. The training and test sets consist of 156 subjects (448 CMBs) and 81 subjects (183 CMBs), respectively. The geometrical, intensity-based and local image descriptor features were used in the classication steps.

    abstract = {{Diffusion MRI is an imaging technique capable of inferring information about the tissue microstructure, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion MRI data can be analysed using tractography, a tool able to represent the structure of the white matter (WM) in the brain. Tractography is commonly used qualitatively, but in this report, an algorithm for quantitative tractography was developed.

A new evaluation method was developed in order to analyse diffusion parameters in all positions along WM pathways. The developed algorithm was then applied to WM pathways that had been calculated and extracted in a software, based on streamline tractography calculations of the diffusion data. Co-registrations of the data made comparisons across subjects and between groups possible. The algorithm was tested by analysing the inferior-fronto occipital fasciculus (IFO) in males versus females as well as young versus old healthy volunteers. Comparisons were also performed to clinical research projects, by analyzing the IFO in semantic dementia (SD) patients versus healthy controls (HC-SD) and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (IFL) in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) patients versus HC-IUGR.

The calculated values of the diffusion parameters were in agreement with was expected from earlier published results. In the SD patients, diffusion parameters were significant different from the parameters in HC-SD in anterior as well as in posterior parts of the IFO. Large regions of significant differences were present the temporal lobe, when diffusion parameters of the IFL were compared between IUGR patients and HC-IUGR.
In summary, with the aid of an in-house developed algorithm, diffusion parameters could be calculated along the WM pathways. This new evaluation method could lead to a higher sensitivity in detecting local deviations in the properties of the WM pathways, as compared to what could be achieved with conventional analysis methods.}},

    abstract = {{Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dmri) is a technique that can be used to examine the diffusion characteristics of water in the living brain. A recently developed application of this technique is tractography, in which information from brain images obtained using dmri is used to reconstruct the pathways which connect regions of the brain together. Proxy measures for the integrity, or coherence, of these pathways have also been defined using dmri-derived information. The disconnection hypothesis suggests that specific neurological impairments can arise from damage to these pathways as a consequence of the resulting interruption of information flow between relevant areas of cortex. The development of dmri and tractography have generated a considerable amount of renewed interest in the disconnectionist thesis, since they promise a means for testing the hypothesis in vivo in any number of pathological scenarios. However, in order to investigate the effects of pathology on particular pathways, it is necessary to be able to reliably locate them in three-dimensional dmri images. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to improve upon the robustness of existing methods for segmenting specific white matter tracts from image data, using tractography, and to demonstrate the utility of the novel methods for the comparative analysis of white matter integrity in groups of subjects. The thesis begins with an overview of probability theory, which will be a recurring theme throughout what follows, and its application to machine learning. After reviewing the principles of magnetic resonance in general, and dmri and tractography in particular, we then describe existing methods for segmenting particular tracts from group data, and introduce a novel approach. Our innovation is to use a reference tract to define the topological characteristics of the tract of interest, and then search a group of candidate tracts in the target brain volume for the best match to this reference. In order to assess how well two tracts match we define a heuristic but quantitative tract similarity measure. In later chapters we demonstrate that this method is capable of successfully segmenting tracts of interest in both young and old, healthy and unhealthy brains; and then describe a formalised version of the approach which uses machine learning methods to match tracts from different subjects. In this case the similarity between tracts is represented as a matching probability under an explicit model of topological variability between equivalent tracts in different brains. Finally, we examine the possibility of comparing the integrity of groups of white matter structures at a level more fine-grained than a whole tract.}},

However, optimal utilization of the widerange of data provided by many directional diffusion dMRI measurements requires careful attention to acquisition and preprocessing. This article will review the preprocessing of dMRI data inlcuding these main steps: reconstruction, tracking and coregistration. The outcome after these steps is the tractography of the whole brain from discrete measured diffusion tensor MRI data. The tractography is also registered in world space which makes it easy to view in any visulization tool. The implementation is done with the help from Dipy (Diffusion Imaging in Python) package, and FSL is used for visualization.}},

We first employ a sampling and culling strategy for generating DTI integral curves and then constrain the curves so that they terminate in gray matter. We then employ a clustering method based on a proximity measure calculated between every pair of curves. We interactively selected a proximity threshold to achieve visually optimal clustering in models from four DTI datasets. An expert rater then assigned a confidence rating about bundle presence and accuracy for each of 12 target fiber bundles of varying calibers and type in each dataset. We then created a fiber bundle template to cluster and label the fiber bundles automatically in new datasets. According to expert evaluation, the automated proximity-based clustering and labeling algorithm consistently yields anatomically plausible fiber bundles on large and coherent clusters.

    abstract = {{This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to the Stejskal–Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration, eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion, which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization. We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased brain tissue.}},

@article{bihan2001tensor,
    abstract = {{The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:534–546. {\copyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

@article{smith2002automated,
    abstract = {{An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against  ” gold-standard” hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum.
