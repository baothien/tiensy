We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1}},

in a broad range of scientific applications. However, in many problems it may
be expensive to obtain or compute similarities between the items to be
clustered. This paper investigates the hierarchical clustering of N items based
on a small subset of pairwise similarities, significantly less than the
complete set of N(N-1)/2 similarities. First, we show that if the intracluster
similarities exceed intercluster similarities, then it is possible to correctly
determine the hierarchical clustering from as few as 3N log N similarities. We
demonstrate this order of magnitude savings in the number of pairwise
similarities necessitates sequentially selecting which similarities to obtain
in an adaptive fashion, rather than picking them at random. We then propose an
active clustering method that is robust to a limited fraction of anomalous
similarities, and show how even in the presence of these noisy similarity
values we can resolve the hierarchical clustering using only O(N log^2 N)
pairwise similarities.}},

In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Many bioinformatics analyses, ranging from gene clustering to phylogenetics, produce hierarchical trees as their main result. These are used to represent the relationships among different biological entities, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretation. A number of standalone programs are available that focus on tree visualization or that perform specific analyses on them. However, such applications are rarely suitable for large-scale surveys, in which a higher level of automation is required. Currently, many genome-wide analyses rely on tree-like data representation and hence there is a growing need for scalable tools to handle tree structures at large scale.RESULTS:Here we present the Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE), a python programming toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees. ETE libraries provide a broad set of tree handling options as well as specific methods to analyze phylogenetic and clustering trees. Among other features, ETE allows for the independent analysis of tree partitions, has support for the extended newick format, provides an integrated node annotation system and permits to link trees to external data such as multiple sequence alignments or numerical arrays. In addition, ETE implements a number of built-in analytical tools, including phylogeny-based orthology prediction and cluster validation techniques. Finally, ETE's programmable tree drawing engine can be used to automate the graphical rendering of trees with customized node-specific visualizations.CONCLUSIONS:ETE provides a complete set of methods to manipulate tree data structures that extends current functionality in other bioinformatic toolkits of a more general purpose. ETE is free software and can be downloaded from http://ete.cgenomics.org webcite.}},

    abstract = {{Numerous multivariate visualization techniques and systems have been developed in the past three decades to visually analyze and explore multivariate data being produced daily in application areas ranging from stock markets to the earth and space sciences. However, traditional multivariate visualization techniques typically do not scale well to large multivariate data sets, with the latter becoming more and more common nowadays. This paper proposes a general framework for interactive hierarchical displays (IHDs) to tackle the clutter problem faced by traditional multivariate visualization techniques when analyzing large data sets. The underlying principle of this framework is to develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and to use hierarchical variations of traditional multivariate visualization techniques to convey aggregation information about the resulting clusters. Users can then explore their desired focus region at different levels of detail, using our suite of navigation and filtering tools. We describe this IHD framework and its full implementation on four traditional multivariate visualization techniques, namely, parallel coordinates (Inselberg and Dimsdale, Proceedings of Visualization (1990) 361; Wegman, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 411(85) (1990) 664), star glyphs (Siegel et al., Surgery 72 (1972) 126), scatterplot matrices (Cleveland and McGill, Dynamics Graphics for Statistics (1988)), and dimensional stacking (LeBlanc et al., Proceedings of Visualization 90 (1995) 271), as implemented in the XmdvTool system (Ward, Proceedings of Visualization 94 (1994) 326; Martin and Ward, Proceedings of Visualization 95 (1995) 271; Fua et al., Proceedings of Visualization 99 (1999) 43; Proceedings of Information Visualization 99 (1999) 58).

Users need data representations serving different purposes: from seeing overall structure and data coverage to evolutionary processes during a particular season. Our approach to the problem is in constructing hierarchies of data representations, and providing users with representations adaptable to specific goals. It can be done efficiently because the structure of a typical influenza dataset is characterized by low estimated values of the Kolmogorov (box) dimension. Multi-scale methodologies allow interactive visual representation of the dataset and accelerate computations by importance sampling. Our tree visualization approach is based on a subtree aggregation with subscale resolution. It allows interactive refinements and coarsening of subtree views. For importance sampling large influenza datasets, we construct sets of well-scattered points (e-nets). While a tree build for a global sample provides a coarse-level representation of the whole dataset, it can be complemented by trees showing more details in chosen areas. To reflect both global dataset structure and local details correctly, we perform local refinement gradually, using a multiscale hierarchy of e-nets. Our hierarchical representations allow fast metadata searching.}},

It has immediately received considerable attention in several disciplines, particularly in the complex systems literature, although its properties are not well understood. We study the problem of finding clusterings with maximum modularity, thus providing theoretical foundations for past and present work based on this measure. More precisely, we prove the conjectured hardness of maximizing modularity both in the general case and with the restriction to cuts and give an Integer Linear Programming formulation. This is complemented by first insights into the behavior and performance of the commonly applied greedy agglomerative approach.}},

    abstract = {{We propose a hybrid clustering method, hierarchical ordered partitioning and collapsing hybrid (HOPACH), which is a hierarchical tree of clusters. The methodology combines the strengths of both partitioning and agglomerative clustering methods. At each node, a cluster is partitioned into two or more smaller clusters with an enforced ordering of the clusters. Collapsing steps uniting the two closest clusters into one cluster can be used to correct for errors made in the partitioning steps. We implement a version of HOPACH which optimizes a measure of clustering strength, such as average silhouette, at each partitioning and collapsing step. An important benefit of a hierarchical tree is that one can look at clusters at increasing levels of detail. We propose to visualize the clusters at any level of the tree by plotting the distance matrix corresponding with an ordering of the clusters and an ordering of elements within the clusters. A final ordered list of elements is obtained by running down the tree completely. The bootstrap can be used to establish the reproducibility of the clusters and the overall variability of the followed procedure. The power of the methodology compared to current algorithms is illustrated with simulated and publicly available cancer gene expression data sets.}},

It provides a synchronised, multiple view environment for visualising, exploring and managing large hierarchies. HVS reads hierarchies either from the file system or from TreeML files. Eleven hierarchy browsers have so far been implemented within HVS, including: traditional tree views, the classic Walker tree layout, information pyramids, treemaps, a hyperbolic browser, sunburst, and cone trees. In addition to being a tool to explore and manage hierarchies, HVS was also designed to provide a platform for the empirical evaluation and comparison of different hierarchy browsers. The hierarchical visualisation testing environment (HVTE) is a semi-automated testing environment built on top of HVS. HVTE is being used for a series of comparative studies of hierarchy browsers.}},

    abstract = {{Segmenting semantically meaningful whole objects from images is a challenging problem, and it becomes especially so without higher level common sense reasoning. In this paper, we present an interactive segmentation framework that integrates image appearance and boundary constraints in a principled way to address this problem. In particular, we assume that small sets of pixels, which are referred to as seed pixels, are labeled as the object and background. The seed pixels are used to estimate the labels of the unlabeled pixels using Dirichlet process multiple-view learning, which leverages 1) multiple-view learning that integrates appearance and boundary constraints and 2) Dirichlet process mixture-based nonlinear classification that simultaneously models image features and discriminates between the object and background classes. With the proposed learning and inference algorithms, our segmentation framework is experimentally shown to produce both quantitatively and qualitatively promising results on a standard dataset of images. In particular, our proposed framework is able to segment whole objects from images given insufficient seeds.}},

Recently it has been shown that it is also useful for identifying concerns in source code. The tree cutting strategy plays an important role in obtaining the clusters, which identify the concerns. In this contribution the authors compare two tree cutting strategies: the Dynamic Hybrid cut and the commonly used fixed height threshold. Two case studies have been performed on the source code of Philips Healthcare to compare the results using both approaches. While some of the settings are particular to the Philips-case, the results show that applying a dynamic threshold, implemented by the Dynamic Hybrid cut, is an improvement over the fixed height threshold in the detection of clusters representing relevant concerns. This makes the approach as a whole more usable in practice.}},

However, hierarchical clustering algorithms do not actually create clusters, but compute only a hierarchical representation of the data set. This makes them unsuitable as an automatic pre-processing step for other algorithms that operate on detected clusters. This is true for both dendrograms and reachability plots, which have been proposed as hierarchical clustering representations, and which have different advantages and disadvantages. In this paper we first investigate the relation between dendrograms and reachability plots and introduce methods to convert them into each other showing that they essentially contain the same information. Based on reachability plots, we then introduce a technique that automatically determines the significant clusters in a hierarchical cluster representation. This makes it for the first time possible to use hierarchical clustering as an automatic pre-processing step that requires no user interaction to select clusters from a hierarchical cluster representation.}},

    abstract = {{Summary: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible—cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein–protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. Availability: The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting  Contact: stevitihit@yahoo.com Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},
