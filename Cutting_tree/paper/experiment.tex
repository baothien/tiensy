In this project, we use the height of the cluster $C_i$ within the hierarchical tree $\mathcal{H}$ to measure the level of detail of that cluster. Let $h$ be the height of hierarchical tree $\mathcal{H}$: $h = height(\mathcal{H})$. $s_{min} = 0$, corresponds to the leaf with zero heigh, $s_{max} = 1$ is at the root of the tree $\mathcal{H}$, and $\forall C_i \in \mathcal{H}, s(C_i) = \frac{height(C_i)}{h}$, where $heigh(C_i)$ is the heigh of the cluster $C_i$~\cite{yang2003interactive}
%s = [0,1], where 0 is the whole leaves (streamlines) and 1 is the only one root. Scale s can be defined based on the height of tree h: 0/h, 1/h, ..., (h-1)/h, h/h; or the maximum distance of each node of the tree \cite{yang2003interactive}
